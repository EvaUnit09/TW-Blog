# Debugging - HTB Notes

## Overview

Debugging in Bash helps identify and fix errors in scripts. Bash provides built-in debugging options that allow step-by-step execution tracking.

---

## Problem Description: Identifying and Fixing Script Errors

A script should display its execution process to help debug issues such as incorrect logic, missing arguments, or syntax errors.

### **Input & Output**

**Input:** Bash script with potential errors  
**Output:** Debugging information with executed commands

**Example Execution:**

```bash
bash -x script.sh
```

**Example Output:**

```
+ '[' 0 -eq 0 ']'
+ echo -e 'You need to specify the target domain.\n'
You need to specify the target domain.
```

---

## Topics & Patterns

- **`-x` (xtrace)**: Shows executed commands before output.
- **`-v` (verbose)**: Displays script source code and executed commands.
- **Combining Flags (`bash -x -v script.sh`)**: Provides full debugging details.

---

## Solution & Complexity

### **Key Ideas**

- `bash -x script.sh`: Tracks command execution.
- `bash -v script.sh`: Displays source code and execution.
- `set -x / set +x`: Enables/disables debugging within scripts.

### **Python Equivalent**

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
logging.debug("Debug message: Script started")
```

**Complexity:**

- **Debugging execution:** **O(n)** where `n` is the number of script lines.
- **Output tracking:** **O(1)** for single-step execution tracking.

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

| Step | Description                  | Command Used          |
| ---- | ---------------------------- | --------------------- |
| 1    | Enable debugging             | `bash -x script.sh`   |
| 2    | Enable verbose mode          | `bash -v script.sh`   |
| 3    | Debug only specific sections | `set -x` and `set +x` |
