# üìñ Topic: OpenCTI (Cyber Threat Intelligence Platform) ‚Äî TryHackMe Room Walkthrough

> _A breakdown of OpenCTI, an open-source platform for managing Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), exploring its features, structure, and how it helps with threat analysis._

---

## üîë Key Points

- **OpenCTI Definition:** Open-source platform for storage, analysis, and presentation of threat campaigns, malware, and indicators of compromise (IOCs).
- **Data Model:** Uses STIX2 standards for structuring threat intel as entities and relationships.
- **Integration Capabilities:** Can integrate with MITRE ATT&CK, MISP, TheHive, and more.
- **Dashboard Overview:** Provides visual summaries of threat data with widgets on entities, relationships, and reports.
- **Key Sections:**
  - Activities & Knowledge: Helps analysts investigate incidents and enrich knowledge.
  - Analysis & Events: Central for processing reports and hunting suspicious activities.
  - Observations: Maps technical indicators to assist in threat correlation.
  - Arsenal: Lists tools, malware, attack patterns, and vulnerabilities.
  - Entities: Categorizes data by sectors, countries, orgs, etc.
- **Platform Architecture:**
  - GraphQL API for database connection.
  - Python workers for async processing.
  - Connectors for data ingestion and export.

## üí° Why It Matters

- Provides a centralized view of threat intelligence, reducing the complexity of managing multiple threat feeds and sources.
- Helps security teams correlate threats, understand attacker tactics, and respond faster.
- Supports collaboration by structuring both technical and non-technical data.
- Critical tool for SOC analysts and threat hunters in operational environments.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Real-Life Use Cases

- **SOC Investigation:** Analysts can track malware like CaddyWiper or threat actors like APT37, gather insights and correlate attack patterns.
- **Incident Response:** Helps teams quickly map out IOCs and enrich investigations with context.
- **Vulnerability Management:** By linking CVEs, OpenCTI can support patch prioritization.
- **Reporting:** Enables creating detailed threat reports for stakeholders.

_(Personal note: I could see this being valuable in real-world environments where multiple data sources need to be unified, like in enterprise SOCs.)_

## üìù TL;DR

- OpenCTI is an open-source CTI platform that helps analysts manage, visualize, and act on threat intelligence.
- It integrates with multiple tools and structures data using STIX2.
- Supports real-time threat hunting and investigation workflows.

## üöÄ Next Steps / What I Want to Explore

- Experiment with setting up an OpenCTI instance in my lab environment.
- Test integrations with TheHive and MISP.
- Dive deeper into connector development for custom data sources.
- Explore how OpenCTI feeds into SIEM platforms for proactive monitoring.
